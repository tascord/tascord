### Ello
I'm tascord, or Oscar, a student and developer of awful, terrible things.

Things I'm working on at the moment:
- [cRob](https://github.com/tascord/cRob) (Discord Bot)
- [AAL](https://github.com/AAL-Org) (Discord Bot)

My favourite language is funny nodejs, because its easy to develop in. For important stuff I don't tend to use it.
My pronouns are he/him, and you may contact me at [oscar_hill@icloud.com](mailto:oscar_hill@icloud.com) I don't know why you would though, with all that I do.
